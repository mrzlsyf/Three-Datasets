# 📌 Three Datasets 🔢
🚀 This project demonstrates **Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and Regression models** using well-known datasets from **Scikit-Learn**.

---

## 🎯 Overview
This system performs three key tasks:
1. **Naive Bayes Classification on the Iris Dataset** 🌸
2. **Decision Tree Classification on the Breast Cancer Dataset** 🎗️
3. **Regression Analysis on the Diabetes Dataset** 💉

This project is valuable for **machine learning practitioners, students, and researchers** to understand different ML models applied to diverse datasets.

---

## 🏠 Project Workflow 📌
1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing** 📊
   - Loads datasets from Scikit-Learn (`load_iris`, `load_breast_cancer`, `load_diabetes`).
   - Splits data into training and testing sets.

2. **Model Implementation & Training** 🤖
   - Implements **Naive Bayes** for the Iris dataset.
   - Applies **Decision Tree Classifier** to the Breast Cancer dataset.
   - Uses **Regression models** (Scikit-Learn and StatsModels) for Diabetes data.

3. **Model Evaluation** 📈
   - Evaluates performance using accuracy, confusion matrices, and R-squared.
